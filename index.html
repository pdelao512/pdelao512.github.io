			<p>I was Born December 26 1987 in San Antonio Tx, and grew up about 20 miles north In New Braunfels Tx. Home to the original Schlitterban Waterpark. I graduated from New Braunfels High School in 2006. I have a dog name Whitey and a cat named Ms Kitty. I currently am self employed. I refinish furniture and sell it on Craiglist or one of the local area apps like 5mile; While time consuming the final product is well worth the hours I invested into it. I tend to be a bit of a homebody and tv matrathon junkie. Some of my favorite shows include Game of Thrones, Supernatural, Last man Standing, and Dexter. I'm Still mad about how it ended. My musical tastes are all over the place from Katy Perry to Bone thugs n harmony. But im and old soul at heart. My main genre is classic rock. Some of my favorites include Pinkfloyd, Allmen Brothers, CSN and sometimes Y, and White Snake 'Lome me some power ballads'; but my favorite is Fleetwood Mac. I was got to see them in concert last year in Dallas. I would have seen them in Austin but the only tickets they still had available were $600. That's a little steep for me.</p>
